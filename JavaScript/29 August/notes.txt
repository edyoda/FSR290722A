3 Fundamental Tech of Web Development : 
    1. HTML
    2. CSS
    3. JavaScript

JavaScript ? Is a language which is used to create features in a web page.

Client-Server Model : 
Front End : Everything visible on browser. (Client)
    Vanilla JS, jQuery, React, Angular, Vue etc...  
Back End : Things/stuff kept on server. (Server)
    NodeJS, BackboneJS, EmberJS etc..
Database : Used to store data
    MongoDB, MySQL, Cassendra etc...


JavaScript :
1. Variable : It will store some value which can vary from time to time.

How to write a variable in JS ?
var <name-of-variable> = <value-of-variable>;

Rules of naming variables :
1. You can not give a space in name of variable.
2. You can write alphabets, digits, _ and $ in the name of variables.
3. You can not start a variable name with a digit however you can start a variable name with _ and $


Type of cases in naming a variable : 
var user_rank = 1; // snake case
var UserRank = 1; // Pascal case
var userRank = 1; // camel case


Data Type : The type of data a variable is holding.
1. Primitive/Fundamental Data Type
    1.1 Number : 1,2,3,10,20,21.12,300.123, -1, -20 etc
    1.2 String : John, 123 ABC Street etc
    1.3 Boolean : true/false
    1.4 Null : Does not holds any type of data i.e null type of data
    1.5 Undefined : When a variable has only the declaration part
2. Non-Primitive/Adavanced Data Type
    2.1 Array [] : Collection of same type of data
    2.2 Object {} : Collection of same/different types of data (in the form of key value pair).


Writing a variable in JS consists of 2 parts : 
    1. Variable Declaration : Informing JS about a variable with its name
    2. Variable Definition : Assigning a value to a variable.
