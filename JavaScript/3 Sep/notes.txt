Objects in JS/JSON => Collection of key value pair wrapped inside {}

Miscelleneous Stuff : 

Comparision Operator : 
== : It compares only the values
=== : It compares values and data type both

If you want to check if a value is truthy or falsy in JS, put !! in front of the value

Post Increment/Decrement : It uses the value then increase/decreases it. 
Pre Increment/Decrement : It increase/decreases the value then uses it.

Note : 
There can be a single if condition without else part
but there can not be a single else without if part.
