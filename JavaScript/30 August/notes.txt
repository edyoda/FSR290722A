String, Control Flow
String ? Collection of characters

Strings are read by index by computer/programming language.

Hello from JavaScript session on 30 August, 2022

H => 0
e => 1
l => 2
l => 3
o => 4
  => 5
f => 6
r => 7
o => 8
m => 9
...


Note : JS is case sensitive language

Min index in a string is always 0
Max index in a string is always one less than the length of the string.

We use brackets () when we are using a method or a function.
